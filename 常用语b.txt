Workload-Aware Scheduling for Heterogeneous Storage Data Analytics


the unbalanced use on either specific type of storage or particular device would easily elongate the latency on reading data, worsening the overall performance for analytical tasks

 we propose a randomized algorithm (WASH-rdm) which can be proved concentrated on its optimum value with high probability through our theoretical analysis.

this proposed problem

we design a randomized algorithm (WASH-rdm) which chooses source devices based on delicate calculated probabilities

Extensive experiments show that 

 reduce the reading time for tasks by up to 55\% over the state-of-the-art baseline algorithm
